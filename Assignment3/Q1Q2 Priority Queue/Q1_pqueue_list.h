 * Class: PriorityQueue<ValueType>
 * -------------------------------
 * This class models a linear structure called a priority queue in which
 * values are processed in order of priority.  As in conventional English
 * usage, lower priority numbers correspond to higher effective priorities,
 * so that a priority 1 item takes precedence over a priority 2 item.
